Issue Summary
Duration of Outage:
The outage occurred on August 18, 2024, starting at 10:30 AM UTC and lasting until 12:00 PM UTC.

Impact:
The service affected was the user authentication system of our e-commerce platform. During the outage, 80% of users experienced failed login attempts, resulting in a significant reduction in user activity. Approximately 60% of ongoing transactions were abandoned, and customer support was overwhelmed with complaints regarding login issues.

Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was a misconfigured update to the authentication server. An incorrect setting in the server's configuration file caused the authentication API to crash under high load, preventing users from successfully logging in.

Timeline
10:30 AM: Issue detected by monitoring alerts showing a spike in failed login attempts.
10:32 AM: The engineering team was notified via automated alerts and customer complaints.
10:35 AM: Initial investigation focused on the database, assuming it was a connection issue due to previous similar incidents.
10:45 AM: Database ruled out as the cause; attention shifted to the authentication server.
11:00 AM: Misleading path identified when inspecting network latency, delaying the diagnosis.
11:15 AM: Escalated to the DevOps team for deeper inspection of server configurations.
11:30 AM: Configuration error identified in the authentication server settings.
11:45 AM: Configuration was corrected, and the authentication server was restarted.
12:00 PM: Service fully restored, with login functionality returning to normal.
Root Cause and Resolution
The issue was caused by an incorrect configuration in the authentication server settings. Specifically, a recent update to the server introduced a new parameter that was incorrectly set, leading to the server's inability to handle high volumes of authentication requests. This misconfiguration caused the authentication API to fail, preventing users from logging in.

To resolve the issue, the misconfigured parameter was identified by the DevOps team during a review of the server settings. Once the correct configuration was applied, the server was restarted, and the authentication service resumed normal operation. A thorough test was conducted to ensure that the service was stable before concluding the resolution.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
To prevent this issue from occurring in the future, the following steps will be taken:

Improve Configuration Management:

Implement a review process for all server configuration changes.
Ensure that changes are peer-reviewed before deployment to production.
Enhance Monitoring and Alerts:

Add specific alerts for authentication API failures to detect issues faster.
Monitor configuration changes and their impact on system performance.
Conduct Load Testing:

Perform load testing on the authentication server after each update to ensure it can handle expected traffic volumes.
Training and Documentation:

Provide training for the engineering team on the importance of configuration management.
Update the documentation to include best practices for server configuration and handling high-traffic scenarios.
Task List:

Patch the authentication server to correct the configuration error.
Add monitoring for the specific parameter that caused the issue.
Implement a peer-review process for server configuration changes.
Schedule regular load testing of the authentication server.
Update training materials and documentation related to server configuration.
